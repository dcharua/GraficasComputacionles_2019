# First Idea: Flappy Bird 3D
- ### Objective/Idea of the project
The project will be a kind of flappy bird but instead of being 2D and in a phone controlled by taps would be in 3D controlled with keys. The main camera would be like mounted on the back of the bird and you would have to pass thourgh pipes and other kinds of obstacles for accumulate points, in order to make a top score. Another difference will be that the bird in the traditional 2D game only goes up and down, while in this version it will move up, down, left, right and diagonally.
- ### How the user will interact with the project
As mentioned before, the user will interact with the project by controlling the main character of the game, in order to survive. The controls will be with the arrows of the keyboard of a computer.
